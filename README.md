âœ… Example:

Input: n = 4
Output:

[
 [".Q..",
  "...Q",
  "Q...",
  "..Q."],

 ["..Q.",
  "Q...",
  "...Q",
  ".Q.."]
]

ðŸ’¡ Approach:

Weâ€™ll use Backtracking:

1. Place queens row by row.


2. For each row, try all columns.


3. Check if placing a queen is safe:

No other queen in same column.

No other queen on diagonals.



4. If all queens placed successfully â†’ store the solution.
